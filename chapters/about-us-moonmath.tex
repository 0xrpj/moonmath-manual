\chapter*{About us}

Least Authority is committed to building and supporting the development of usable technology solutions and ethical business practices to advance digital security and preserve privacy as a fundamental human right.

We focus our work on three main areas: Security Consulting, Product Development, and Community-Contribution Projects. We pursue these areas knowing they are complementary and offer various ways for us to contribute to our mission: enabling more people to use secure and privacy-respecting technology. 

Least Authority was founded in 2011 and we moved our headquarters to Berlin, Germany, in 2016, although we remain a global, remote-first team.
